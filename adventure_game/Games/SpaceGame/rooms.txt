Captains Desk
You are standing in front of your desk. You notice that your computer seems to have an emergency notification on its desktop. “It’s probably just a bug, I did send the electricians to fix the security measures around the ship. They must be testing the system”.

Hallway A5
To your right holds your living quarters and in front of you holds the medical room. To your left it seems like the door to the storage room is blocked off by debris. You will need something to get rid of the debris to enter that room. It seems that the hallway is a dark red due to the alarm system still going off. You wonder if these electricians are still testing…

A shattered light bar is on the floor of this very dim room. You can see that the door to the armoury is buried with debris from the roof.

Custodial Closet
You see a few custodial supplies scattered around the closet. Nothing that special here. You notice last second that there is an air vent at the top of the room which needs a screwdriver to open it up.

The room is filled with a mysterious green smoke. It’s getting harder to breath the deaper you travel into the smoke. Looking north you find the entrance to the cafeteria. You can also spot the source to your right. Maybe finding something that can filter out the smoke could be crucial.

Gym 
You enter your ship’s gym. Honestly, it looks very well kept for some reason, I guess no one ever goes here. The big windows on walls around the gym are a beautiful view while you work out. Nothing too special in this room. West leads to hallway B4 and south leads to the armoury.
