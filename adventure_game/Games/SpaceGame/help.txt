To play this game you must move between locations and interact with objects by typing one or two word commands.

Some commands are motion commands.  These will move you from room to room. Motion commands include:

NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST

Not all motions are possible in every room. In addition, some rooms may have "special" or "secret" motion commands.

There are other action commands in the game. These include:

COMMANDS: this will print the moves that are legal in a given room.
HELP: this will display instructions
INVENTORY: this will print your current inventory.
LOOK: this will print the description for the current room.
TAKE <object>: this will take an object from a room and place it in your inventory. Replace <object> with the name of the object to take.  The object must be present in the room in order to take it.
DROP <object>: this will drop an object in your inventory. Replace <object> with the name of the object to drop. The object must be in your inventory to drop it.

The game is also fully playable with the keyboard through the usage of the following keybinds:

ACCEPT/ENTER: Use selected item.
E: Selects and loops through inventory items.
Q: Selects and loops through room items.
F: Clears the selected item.

W/UP: Moves the player north or attacks if in a battle.
A/LEFT: Moves the player west, does nothing if in a battle.
D/RIGHT: Moves the player east, does nothing if in a battle.
S/DOWN: Moves the player south, retreats if in a battle.

L: Runs the LOOK command.
H: Runs the HELP command.
C: Runs the COMMANDS command.
R: Says the player's current health (and the enemy's current health if present).

Some paths may be blocked.  To unblock a path you may need a specific object to be in your inventory.

The game is over when your player reaches the VICTORY room, or when your player DIES.
